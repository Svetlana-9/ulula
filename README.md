# README

This application is under developing. Thus, the following description declares the basic principles and objectives.

## About

The `ulula` is a simple peer-to-peer messanger. It does not need a public IP and can work behind the NAT. To connect, peers find out their current IP address using the STUN server and, if necessary, punch the NAT. The email is used as a signaling service and for the exchange of IP addresses.

## Using

Install app to your computer, bind email account to your messanger, add email of some friend who also use `ulula` to the contact book. You will be able to communicate as soon as he agrees to your invitation. But keep in mind that the message can only be delivered when a direct connection is established, since there are no intermediate servers and you cannot send a message to someone who is offline and then disconnect yourself.
